Welcome to Sticky/2 for OS/2

This program is a simple TCP/IP Client Server program.
It allows you to send Sticky Notes across a TCP/IP network.

This is version 1.02 so lots can be added, just let me know.
Send any enhancement requests to awysocki@Bearsoft.com.

INSTALLING:
To install Sticky/2 just unzip the programs into a subdirectory
and run the Sticky/2 program.  Sticky/2 will create its .INI, .LOG
and .DBG file in the same directory where the program is found.
So you do not have to drag the .EXE file to your desktop.  Create
a program object if you want the Sticky/2 program on your desktop.

Or just run the MAKEWPS.CMD FROM THE DIRECTORY where STICKY2.EXE will
be kept.  MAKEWPS will create and Program object on your desktop, you
can then move it wherever your heart desires.


REGISTRATION:
There is no fee if you are using it at home, but if you are
the government or a business.  I do ask that you send $5.00
per user.  I believe in letting big business pay for my compiler
and computer time.

To register Sticky/2 All I ask is that you send me a note,
with the Subject line stating 'I'm using Sticky/2'
Thats it.  I only want to count how many people try the program
and are using it.  Since I'm only one person, I only provide E-Mail support.
I can't provide auto-updates of the code, or other fancy stuff like that.
I will promise to keep the Sticky/2 Home page up to date, and try to keep the
OS/2 download sites updated.

So to register:  Send a note to:

To:     AWYSOCKI@Bearsoft.com
Subj:   I'm using Sticky/2


Thanks
Andy
